# Whodunnit

Count and blame your repo.

## About

Whodunnit is a command-line TUI that counts and categorizes the number of lines in a repo by filetype and contributor. It was originally created to gather data about a class project, and expanded on to be more useable and useful.

## Installation

_Whodunnit is currently in prerelease._

You can download the latest release of Whodunnit from the [releases](https://github.com/connorgannaway/whodunnit/releases) page, or through:

```bash
# go
go install github.com/connorgannaway/whodunnit@latest

# homebrew
brew tap connorgannaway/whodunnit
brew install whodunnit

# ubuntu
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/connorgannaway/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury-connorgannaway.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install whodunnit
```

## Usage

Run `whodunnit` in a directory you wish to count or (optionally) pass a directory to target as the first argument. If no directory is specified, the current directory is used.

```bash
whodunnit [options...] [directory]
```

Filepaths matching .gitignore entries will be excluded. There are slight discrepancies in the total count and the added contribution counts due to how git counts contributions.

### Command Line Options

| Option                 | Description                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--withDotFiles`       | Include files beginning with a '.'. Caveat: some dotfiles are likely to still be excluded by the Configuration File check. |
| `--withConfigFiles`    | Include configuration files (eslint.config.js, nx.json, etc.)                                                              |
| `--withGeneratedFiles` | Include files deemed to be generated by tools or other code.                                                               |
| `--withVendorFiles`    | Include files on a vendor filepath.                                                                                        |
| `--json`               | Export data to stdout in json format instead of launching the TUI.                                                         |
